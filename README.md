Design Patterns Assignment
This repository contains implementations of various design patterns as part of two exercises. Each exercise showcases different design patterns categorized into creational, structural, and behavioral patterns.

Exercise 1
In this exercise, the following design patterns were implemented:

1. Creational Patterns
Factory Patterns: Implemented two factory patterns to demonstrate how to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.
Singleton Pattern: Implemented the singleton pattern to ensure that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
2. Structural Patterns
Decorator Pattern: Implemented to dynamically add behavior or responsibilities to objects without affecting other objects.
Adapter Pattern: Created to allow incompatible interfaces to work together, enabling the use of existing classes in a new way.
3. Behavioral Patterns
Observer Pattern: Implemented to establish a one-to-many dependency between objects, allowing one object to notify multiple observers about changes in its state.
Strategy Pattern: Created to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. This allows clients to choose which algorithm to use at runtime.

Exercise 2
In this exercise, the following was accomplished:
Implemented the Command Pattern for statement number 6. This pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations. It also supports undoable operations.
