# Design Patterns Assignment

This repository contains implementations of various design patterns as part of two exercises. Each exercise showcases different design patterns categorized into creational, structural, and behavioral patterns.

## Exercise 1

In this exercise, the following design patterns were implemented:

### Creational Patterns
- **Factory Patterns**: 
  - Implemented two factory patterns to demonstrate how to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.
  
- **Singleton Pattern**: 
  - Implemented the singleton pattern to ensure that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

### Structural Patterns
- **Decorator Pattern**: 
  - Implemented to dynamically add behavior or responsibilities to objects without affecting other objects.

- **Adapter Pattern**: 
  - Created to allow incompatible interfaces to work together, enabling the use of existing classes in a new way.

### Behavioral Patterns
- **Observer Pattern**: 
  - Implemented to establish a one-to-many dependency between objects, allowing one object to notify multiple observers about changes in its state.

- **Strategy Pattern**: 
  - Created to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. This allows clients to choose which algorithm to use at runtime.

## Exercise 2

In this exercise, the following was accomplished:
- **Command Pattern**: 
  - Implemented for statement number 6. This pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations. It also supports undoable operations.
